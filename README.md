# Funding NFT

## Introduction

We small repo showing how to use a Manager contract to

- manage minting of ERC20 tokens
- deploying NFTs (just ERC721 for now)
- allocating ERC20 tokens to tokens in the NFT

## Hardhat

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
